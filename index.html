          <h2>What</h2>
          <p>
            Callisto is (hopefully) a helpful toolkit containing some utilities and UI controls to help complete your app's Windows UI style quickly as well as 
            consistent with the Windows UI guidelines.  
            <br/><br/>
            Each control has made every attempt to be pixel/animation perfect to the OS experiences seen in Windows 8.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="span3">
          <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>
            Since Windows 8 was announced I had been working on application building and had found a few things that were common that I needed in my apps.  I kept re-writing them 
            and decided just to encapsulate them in a library.
            <br/><br/>Additionally at the release of Windows 8 there are some small gaps in UI controls in the XAML platform that 
            make it easy to build Windows UI style apps.  It is not impossible, but I made Callisto to hopefully make them easier.
            <br/><br/>
            Callisto grew from app development and extracted from apps initially.  I hope you find it useful.

          <h2>How</h2>
          <p>
            I've tried to make it very easy to acquire Callisto for your use, whether you are a developer who just wants the lib, or you want the source.  
            Callisto is available in source-code form on <a href="http://github.com/timheuer/callisto" title="Get the source code on GitHub">GitHub</a> or in binary form via <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Callisto" title="Add the NuGet package to your project quickly">NuGet</a> or the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0526563b-7a48-4b17-a087-a35cea701052" title="Install the toolkit from the Visual Studio gallery">Visual Studio Gallery</a>.

            <h2>Learn</h2>
            <p>
            The docs for Callisto are always evolving to try to be better.  The <a href="https://github.com/timheuer/callisto/wiki">wiki docs</a> are the 
            place where the docs will continue to get better on specific use cases of the library.  In the meantime, the source code has a test app that shows some 
            usage of controls and is a decent starting example as docs continue to get better.

                The Callisto project is an Open Source project available to everyone to use and change.  The project was initially started by <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/" title="Tim Heuer's Blog">Tim Heuer</a> 
                however has received inspiration and contributions from many others.  In some cases controls were ports/updates of existing controls from other Open Source libraries. 
                Tim remains the project coordinator but encourages contributions in an open dialog manner.  
                <br/><br/>
                Tim has worked as a developer for years helping customers in all industries.  He currently works as a Program Manager on Windows UI platforms at Microsoft.  He can 
                be found writing on his blog at <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/">http://timheuer.com/blog/</a>, on <a href="http://twitter.com/timheuer">Twitter</a> and often in the 
                developer forums for MSDN or Stack Overflow helping customers with issues.
